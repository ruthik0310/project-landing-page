      <h2>Features</h2>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Feature 1</h3>
        <p>Acrylic glass/crystal: A type of plastic sometimes used as the glass covering for watch dials This is less scratch resistant than mineral glass or sapphire, though is more malleable and cheaper to produce. Often found in low-end watches. 

            Analogue display: A watch dial that displays the time using hands. 
            
            Automatic movement: A type of mechanical wristwatch that utilises physical movement from the user typically via a weighted rotor, positioned at the bottom of the mechanism. The motion of this rotor winds the mainspring ‘automatically’, without the user having to manually wind the watch using the crown. This energy helps the watch to keep accurate time. These movements will require servicing every few years, to maintain the watch. 
            
            Backlight: A light, manually activated by the user, that illuminates the watch dial. Popular implementations include Timex’s Indiglo and Casio’s ‘illuminator’ backlights. 
            
            Bezel: The ring surrounding the dial and glass. This can be plain or can offer functionality, in the form of a tachymeter or dive watch bezel; the latter of which rotates. These can be made out of various types of metal or ceramic. 
            
            Bracelet: A watch strap/band constructed of metal.
            
            Buckle: The fastening method typically used to connect two ends of a standard watch strap.  1.</p>
